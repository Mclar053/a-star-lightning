#Pathfinding - Storm (Art Piece)

Using the A* pathfinding algorithm, I have managed to created a piece of animated art that has the appearance of lightning. Using a tile grid and 100's of random walkers, they find a route to walk and once they have finished their route, they find a new route. However, at the same time, their route and search distance is displayed in the form of a lightning cloud.

This was made for fun over the course of 3 days.

##To Run
Just open the .pde file and run the code.
